# Toronto Soccer Shop - Project Reference

## Project
- Site: torontosoccershop.com
- Store: Absolute Soccer Mississauga
- Stack: React + Vite + Supabase + Vercel
- GitHub: zizu10101/Absolute-Website
- Supabase ref: nvyfktdhzhujeltkbgrz
- Admin email: info@edgedbs.com
- POS PIN: 2024 (env: VITE_POS_PIN)

## Key Files
- src/pages/POSPage.tsx
- src/pages/AdminPage.tsx
- src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx
- src/utils/thermalReceipt.ts
- src/utils/invoice.ts
- src/context/SettingsContext.tsx
- src/context/ProductContext.tsx
- src/components/BrandBanners.tsx — live "Shop by Brand" component rendered by HomePage.tsx. `BrandShowcase.tsx` also exists in the repo but is unused dead code (not imported anywhere) — don't edit it expecting it to affect the site.
- server.ts — Express server. Most of the app calls Supabase directly from the client; server.ts's `/api/*` routes are only used for POS drawer control, a few admin DB-sync utilities, and Returns. Cash drawer: `POST /api/open-drawer`.
- public/logo-black.png — receipt logo, used across all thermal receipt types

## Database Tables (main branch)
- products, product_variants
- transactions — line items are a `jsonb` column on the row, not a separate table
- customers
- gift_cards, gift_card_transactions
- store_credits, store_credit_transactions
- layaways, pay_later
- returns
- navigation_menus, navigation_items
- settings, blog_posts
- `online_orders` exists only on the unmerged `ecommerce-dev` branch — not present on `main`

**IMPORTANT:** `product_variants` has 2364+ rows. Supabase/PostgREST caps every request at 1000 rows regardless of the `.range()` bounds requested — a single `.range(0, 9999)` call will silently truncate to 1000 rows. Always paginate with a loop:
```js
const batchSize = 1000;
let from = 0;
const all = [];
while (true) {
  const { data } = await supabase.from('product_variants').select('*').range(from, from + batchSize - 1);
  if (!data) break;
  all.push(...data);
  if (data.length < batchSize) break;
  from += batchSize;
}
```

## Printer
- Epson TM-T88V Receipt (1) — Windows printer name
- POS machine's Chrome is launched with `--kiosk-printing` for silent thermal printing
- `POST /api/open-drawer` (server.ts) opens the cash drawer via ESC/POS
- public/logo-black.png used on all receipt types

## Current Branches
- main: live site
- ecommerce-dev: e-commerce Phases 1-5 complete, on hold pending a Stripe integration decision

## Pending Items
- Stripe payment integration (`ecommerce-dev` branch) — if/when going live with online payments
- Receipt width fine-tuning on the Epson TM-T88V — not yet verified against real hardware
- Re-upload logos through Admin → Settings → Theme so existing uploads pick up WebP transparency (the code fix only applies to new uploads, not retroactively)

## Recent Changes (last 3 sessions)
- **Session 62:** "You Might Also Like" related products on the product detail page — matches category + brand + surface type (fg/ag/mg/turf/indoor/sg, parsed from name/submenus) + age group (adult/youth, parsed from name), never mixing surface types even if that yields fewer than 4 results. Replaced the inaccurate "Free Delivery" badge with "In-Store Pickup" (store is pickup-only). Removed a misleading duplicate "Call to order" CTA that rendered under a working size picker.
- **Session 61:** Fixed navigation logo removal not persisting (a stale-logo fallback was silently restoring deleted logos on save). Equipment category page split into two grouped grids by subcategory.
- **Session 60:** Equipment category tiles redesigned to full-bleed dark cards with a top-left text overlay; National Teams/Clubs/Footwear logo grids intentionally left as white cards (they use transparent PNGs that need the white backdrop).

## Key Settings
- Primary color: `var(--primary-color)`, default `#b90014` (red) — set via Admin → Settings → Theme; don't hardcode the hex elsewhere in code
- Google Analytics: G-LP6TC6XHFW
- Microsoft Clarity: xygbsedpg3
- Supabase Storage bucket: `media`
